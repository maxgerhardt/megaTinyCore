/* Wire Register Model
 * by Spence Konde
 *
 * Demonstrates use of the Wire library
 * Implements an example of the "register machine" type of interface provided by most I2C
 * devices, where there are "registers" much like the ones that control on-chip peripherals
 * with the "autoincrement" functionality it is typically paired with.
 * Just like on those, you write a register by writing more than one byte, with the first
 * byte being the first address to write, and the second the value to write there, and if
 * more bytes are written, those are written to successive addresses after that.
 * For a read, you write a single byte, the address of the register you want to start reading
 * from, which sets the "pointer", and then read as many bytes as you want.
 * As with the registers of a microcontroller, some are read-only, containing outputs.
 *
 * Here we allocate an array of bytes, DeviceRegisters[32]
 * it is, very creatively, filled with the numbers 0 through 32.
 * We also define a variable WriteMask[32] which contains a series of constants, one for each "register"
 * only bits that are a 1 can be written.
 * The others will remain unchanged.
 * 0-4 are fully writable
 * the 5 low bits of 5 are writable
 * 6 and 7 are fully writable,
 * 8-11 only allow the 2 low bits in each nybble to be written
 * 12-15 are read-only
 * 16 and 17 allow only the low nybble to be written
 * 18 and 19 allow only the high nybble to be written.
 *
 * The address pointer autoincrements and wraps around.
 *
 * There are two special registers, 4 and 5.
 * (chosen mostly at random, just to demonstrate making things in loop depend on registers)
 * 4 and 5 are the low and high bytes of the time delay used for the blinking... So by default it's 0x0504 ms
 * or 1284 ms.

/* Now - the receive handler is pretty straightforward. Since we will account for the bytes read in the request handler, the receive
 * handler calls it, and doesn't keep the returned value. This resets that count of bytes.
 * the line that sets the byte in the array if a write of more than just the address pointer is performed is ugly, but it's a bog
 * standard application of masks. The bits that are 1 in the mask are set to the new value, so AND the new value with that.
 * The bits that are 0 in the mask remain the same, so invert the mask, and AND that with the old value. OR the two together and set.
 *
 * The bitwise AND of the pointer with 0x1F is to make it wrap around. It's the same as the Modulo (%) operator in that way, except
 * it only works for powers of 2 and is orders of magnitude more efficient - modulo means division, and division is slow and bulky,
 * implemented in software (specifically a routine written in assembly as part of libgcc); point is modulo = division = bad. Never do
 * division on an AVR unless you have to. I have put considerable effort into keeping it out of the micros() calculations.

/* This one is weirder. The way the onRequest behaves and what it needs to do is very counterintuitive (and this model is probably part
 * of WHY all Arduino I2C slave devices use wire like "serial with a clock" instead of like a civilised device....)
 *
 * the handler registered with onRequest is called when the slave gets a packet that matches it's address, set to read; This is called
 * once, and prints out all of the data that the master *might* request. It then does not fire again until the next start condition
 * followed by a matching address. If the master gets all the data the slave prepared, the slave NACKs the first byte beyond what it has.
 * and the standard API does not provide any means for the slave to determine in any way how much the master read!
 *
 * Without the getBytesRead() extension, there is no way for a slave written through the Arduino API to react to whether the master has
 * something - and that's a very common behavior in commercial I2C devices.

  // Making something to react would be done above between getting bytes read
  // and adjusting the pointer. If you were implementing a sensor of some sort
  // you might have the result register or the status register do that.
  // The slave might even check during it's loop function to see if
  // Wire.slaveTransactionOpen() ceased to be true, then check getBytesRead() to
  // see if the key register was read __HOWEVER__
  // While this is executing, you must bear in mind that the slave is "clock stretching"
  // Hence avoiding an unduely long execution time should be one of your priorities.
  // Not only is the slave device wasting time, it's wasting the masters time, and that
  // of anything else waiting to use the bus. So like, if you're a sensor manager, you
  // should be storing the values in the "register" array as you take them; you shouldn't go
  // and take a dozen readings during this handler. Dont forget that this is also an ISR
  // with all that that entails
