/* Wire Slave Address Mask
 * by Spence Konde based on work by MX682X
 *
 * Demonstrates use of the new Wire library
 * Receives data as an I2C/TWI slave device
 * Refer to the "Wire Master Multi-Address Write" example for a
 * master to use with this, though "Two Master Write" also works.
 *
 * This example prints the address which triggered the receive function
 * and the data that was sent to the slave on the Serial Monitor, in
 * both text and as hexadecimal (since things other than the test
 * master will rarely be sending ascii text over I2C).
 *
 * It will react to all general call messages, as well as the following
 * addresses: 0x04*, 0x14, 0x24, 0x34, 0x44, 0x54, 0x64, 0x74*.
 * * 0x04 and 0x74 are not valid I2C addresses
 *     0x04-0x07 are used for "high speed" mode (not the same as "fast"
 *       mode or "fast mode+").
 *     0x74 is an address "reserved for future use"
 *
 * Instead of printing from within the ISR, this sets a flag that
 * we check in the main loop (don't print to serial in an ISR. If you
 * have to for debugging, print the fewest characters possible)
 *
 * Since the whole body of the command is stored in the `input` array
 * we disable interrupts while we print it - this is to ensure that we
 * don't get partway though printing it and have it changed out from
 * under us. That isn't catastrophic here, but if we were doing something
 * else with the data it could be.
 *
 * This (more so than the secondary address one) is meant to be a more
 * comprehensive (if not comprehensible) starting point. It's also an
 * example of why I probably shouldn't be writing examples...
 *
 * To use this, you need to connect the SCL and SDA pins of this device to the
 * SCL and SDA pins of a second device running the Two Master Write or
 * Multi Address Write example.

 * To use this with the "Two Master Write" example, you need it connected to
 * both sets of pins.
 * e.g. if master is an AVR DA or DB (the only parts thus far that have two I2C interfaces):
 *    SDA connected to PA2 and PF2 of master and SDA of slave.
 *    SCL connected to PA3 and PF3 of master and SCL of slave.
 *
 * Pullup resistors must be connected between both data lines and Vcc.
 * See the Wire library README.md for more information.
