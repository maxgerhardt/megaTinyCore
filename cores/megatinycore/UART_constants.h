/* CTRLA is interrupt flags, plus 3 some options relevant to RS485
 *
 * | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | USARTn.CTRLA
 * |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 * |RXC|TXC|DRE|RXS| - |ABE| ? | - |  Interrupt Enable bits
 * | -   -   -   - |LBM| - | RS485 |
 *
 * LBME - Loopback Mode Enable turns off RX and ties that channel to TX
 * RS485 - RS485 mode tells it to drive XDIR pin HIGH while transmitting in
 *   order to control an external RS485 line driver. 1 bit of guard time on
 *   either side.
 *
 * RS485 field is strange - on 0/1-series, bit 1 was used was described as
 * an transmit enable field for the UART, so an external device would use
 * that to tell the device when it was allowed to drive the pin. But that
 * has not been described in recent datasheets and the bit is marked as
 * reserved, and only 1 RS485 mode was supported.
 * Just as well - I've never tried it and am unsure of what it was supposed
 * to do, but I suspect you that could debate how something like that "should"
 * work in all the corner cases for weeks. It brings up all a great many
 * issues, was probably a nightmare for designers, and considering the amount
 * of errata on those parts, it probably didn't work very well.

/* CTRLB configures a few major aspects of configuration:
 *
 * | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | USARTn.CTRLB
 * |-------|---|---|---|-------|---|
 * | TX RX | - |SFD|ODM|RX MODE|MPCM
 * |ENABLE | - | Configuration |   |
 *
 * TXEN - enables transmit functionality. When it transitions from enable to
 *    disabled, the pin is forcibly set to an input.
 * RXEN - enables receive functionality
 * SFDEN - enables Start of Frame detection to wake from sleep.
 * ODME - enables Open Drain Mode. Tx pin must be INPUT instead of OUTPUT!
 * MPCM - Multi Processor Communication Mode. A weird Atmel-only feature that
 *   turns a UART into a multidrop bus. I doubt it is in widespread use anywhere.
 *   Looks like the bastard son of UART and I2C that never got enough love or
 *   uptake to prosper. Likely dates to when Phillips was on the warpath
 *   regarding I2C intellectual property. (Maybe they were afraid that they would
 *   be forced to remove the TWI module?) Anyway, the core doesn't support it
 *   and it looks like a really ugly kludge.
 * RXMODE - Controls the baud rate for both sending and receiving. 4 modes:
 *   Normal
 *   U2X - double-speed USART - much less important now with the fractional
 *   baud rate generator, but does the same thing. Serial.begin() chooses this
 *   if it needs to in order to generate the required baud rate only.
 *   GENAUTO - generic auto-baud mode
 *   LINAUTO - LIN constrained auto-baud mode
 * Autobaud mode requires a "break" to be sent followed by a sync (0x55).
 *   LIN mode has more constraints in accordance with that stadatd, while
 *   generic mode has clearly just disabled the checks and added a WFB or
 *   "wait for break" option so you can use autobaud without having to
 *   guess what baud it's using. Serial implements no support for this.
 *   These parts have no trouble keeping a clock accurate enough for serial
 *   and since you need to have control over the software on the the device
 *   that it's talking so you can make it send the break/sync, and you are
 *   also programming this device, wherever it is viable, you know the baud
 *   rate that both ends are set to and don't need it. It's great if you need
 *   to meet the LIN specifications, of course, but that's not a typical or
 *   advisable Arduino use case...
 *
 */

/* Everything contigured by the SERIAL_xPs constants goes right into CTRLC:
 *
 * | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | USARTn.CTRLC
 * |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 * |  MODE | PARITY| SB| CHAR SIZE |
 *
 *
 * Plus there's there's the IRCOM - it is able to take an event input, and
 * you can turn off the pulse coding that nobody's going to use in Arduino-land
 * IRDA has been dead for years - we don't support using that, but we want event input.
 *
 * Additionally there are reasons to want to control to some bits from CTRLA + CTRLB too...
 *
 * It's also not clear yet how it actually behaves when disabled, namely:
 *   Can the event input be used in all modes, or must it be in IRCOM mode?
 *   Do we have to do something that applies the 115200 baud maximum to get it?
 *
 * We want a way to request that only TX, or only RX be enabled, but default should be both.
 * And we want to control Open Drain, RS485 and LoopBack options independently of each other
 *
 * In summary:
 *
 * | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 * | x   x   x |   |LBM|       |485|  CTRLA
 * |TXRX EN|       |ODM| x  __ |   |  CTRLB
 * |                           |IREI  EVCTRL
 * Bits used actively for basic UART are marked with an x.
 *
 * That means 6 bits will be needed. Plus, we sometimes use use one of
 * them internally, and the tinyAVR parts have that funky backwards
 * RS485 option
 * All the ones CTRLA default 0, and so we can AND with 0x09 (or 0x0B on tinyAVR) and OR with other CTRLA settings.
 * And we want the two inverted CTRLB ones in their final locations so we can AND with 0xC0 and XOR the settings
 * we're going to write to CTRLB. The other CTRLB one and the internal need to be done individually, so it doesn't matter
 * that needs to set other options too.
